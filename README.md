# Kisaten

Kisaten is a Ruby extension that enables fuzizng instrumented Ruby code. It implements a fork server and instrumentation that relies on AFL ([american fuzzy lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/)) in a similiar way to to [afl-python](https://github.com/jwilk/python-afl). It works with MRI ((Matz's Ruby Interpreter)[https://github.com/ruby/ruby]), other Ruby interpeters are currently not supported.
