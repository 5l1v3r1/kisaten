Kisaten is a Ruby extension that enables fuzizng instrumented Ruby code. It implements a fork server and instrumentation that relies on AFL ([american fuzzy lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/)). It works with MRI ([Matz's Ruby Interpreter](https://github.com/ruby/ruby)), other Ruby interpeters are currently not supported. The development of this tool was inspired by [afl-python](https://github.com/jwilk/python-afl) and it works in a similiar way that this tool does with Python.
